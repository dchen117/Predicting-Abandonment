## Predicting Abandonment for Open-Source Projects on Github

The primary objective of this project is to answer the key research question: What features of open-source projects are good indicators of the projects’ abandonment, and how can these features be used to predict and measure the likelihood of abandonment? In answering this question, we seek to…

Identify and define the key features of open-source software projects that can predict open-source abandonment
Build a model to predict the likelihood of an open-source project being abandoned
Create a metric to measure the risk of open-source abandonment
